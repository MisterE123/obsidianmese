# [Mod] Obsidian-Mese [obsidianmese]

This MOD for Minetest adds more use for Mese and Obsidian. Add more variety of tools and blocks.
Further Description added by MisterE:
Tools added:
obsidianmese_sword- a good sword that can be crafted with obsidian and mese
obsidianmese_sword_engraved - a uncraftable sword that shoots shards that deal damage, or explode if they hit a node, removing 1 node and causing damage in a radius of 4. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE DROPPED BY DIFFICULT MOBS

obsidianmese_pick - a good pickaxe that can be made with obsidian and mese
obsidianmese_pick_engraved - a good pickaxe that can be made with obsidian and diamond
obsidianmese_axe - cuts down all tree nodes above the one chopped
obsidianmese_hoe - can be used to hoe 4 dirt nodes at once
obsidianmese_shovel - a good shovel, or can be used to compact soil to form paths

also adds: meseapple, 4 of which are craftable from a mese block and 4 apples. It restores full health when eaten.

Original mod included: obsidianmese_boat, which was a boat for lava. It was removed by MisterE from this version.
Original mod included: balrog sword, this is still in the mod, but commented out. It failed testing by MisterE, and was left commented out.
Original mod included obsidianmese chest, which was the same concept as a netherchest or enderchest. This was removed by MisterE, since the server that this is supposed to be installed on already uses netherchests
